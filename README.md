# API_Testing_SOM

This serves as a boilerplate for testing an API, through creating a Service Object Model. The SOM should have several services with a number of methods that are reusable and can easily be used by any member of the teamm without having to understand the code. For instance, the get_status_code method will retrieve the status code for your response only.
